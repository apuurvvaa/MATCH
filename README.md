# MATCH

Project Description:

The goal of this project is to build a clone of the popular dating app, Tinder, with added features for messaging and Google authentication. The app will be built using ContextAPI for managing the state of the application, Tailwind for styling, and Firebase for the backend and real-time database.

The application will allow users to sign in with their Google account, create a profile, and browse through potential matches. Swiping left or right will indicate whether the user is interested in the match or not. If two users both express interest in each other, a match is created and they can start messaging within the app.

The messaging feature will be powered by Firebase's real-time database, enabling users to send and receive messages in real-time. The ContextAPI will be used to manage the state of the messaging feature and ensure that the latest messages are displayed in real-time.

The app will be designed using Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for fast and efficient styling. The app will be optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless experience for users on all platforms.

Overall, this project aims to build a robust and scalable clone of Tinder with added messaging functionality, making use of modern technologies such as ContextAPI, Tailwind, Google Auth, and Firebase.
